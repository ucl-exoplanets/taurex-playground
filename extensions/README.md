# Extensions

These represent a set of extensions that are useful but not quite enough for a full blown package **yet**.

_Note_: These may eventually find there way into the TauREx package itself, but for now they are in a separate repository.

To use these you can either copy the code over to your notebook, import them directly or in the TauREx input file you can write:

```
[Global]
extension_paths = /path/to/extensions
```

Which should make them avaiable in the TauREx input file.
